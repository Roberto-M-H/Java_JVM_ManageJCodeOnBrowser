nudge4j helps great developers understand code better, debug less, have more fun.


## Overview

With nudge4j you can: 

- control your Java application from the browser, as if the browser was a smarter remote control.
- send code from the browser to run on the JVM, 
- experiment with live code. 


To use nudge4j, there is nothing to download.

All you have to do is to add a tiny bit of Java code *(less than 100 lines)* in your program.
