nudge4j is a tiny piece of code to help great developers understand code better, debug less, have more fun.


## Overview

With nudge4j you can: 

- control your Java application from the browser, as if the browser was a smarter remote control.
- send code from the browser to run on the JVM, 
- experiment with live code. 


To use nudge4j, just add [less than 10 lines of code](https://lorenzoongithub.github.io/nudge4j/index.html#Usenudge4j) in your program.
