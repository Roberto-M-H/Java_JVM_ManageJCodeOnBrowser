nudge4j provides an environment for experimenting with code against a running application. You can write, run, and examine the results of code from a browser. A powerful alternative to debugging.



nudge4j executes code written in javascript (<a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html'>nashorn</a>) and comes with an <a href='http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/com/sun/net/httpserver/package-summary.html'>Http Server</a> and an <a href='https://ace.c9.io'>Ace Editor</a> to let code fly from the browser to any java application.


There is nothing to download, just a few lines of java to copy/paste into your program.
